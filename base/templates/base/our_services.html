            <h2>Custom Artwork Commissions</h2>
            <p>Looking for something truly unique? Our platform allows you to commission custom artworks tailored to your specific preferences. If a client books for a custom art service, a date will be scheduled based on available date/time slots in the artist's custom art service portal. During this scheduled session, the artist will create a personalized artwork – be it an individual portrait, family portrait, landscape art, etc., based on your order – via a webcam. The completed artwork will then be delivered to your doorstep using a reliable delivery service. Please note that only registered customers can access custom art commissions. Simply browse through artist profiles, choose the one that resonates with your style, and collaborate directly with them to create a bespoke piece.</p>
